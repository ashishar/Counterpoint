# Counterpoint
This is the code repository for Counterpoint Generation Using Quantum Annnealing.
This code generated counterpoint music for a given cantus firmus in midi format.

The midi files used are included here.

The code basically has two main files 

First Species Counterpoint: First_Species_Counerpoint_In_New_VersionDec.py and
Second Species Counterpoint: Second_Species_Counerpoint_In_New_VersionDec.py

If you want to run any of these you need to simply run either of these files after editing the appropriate input file name <--.mid> in the code.
The output counterpoint is saved in another midi file names as {input file name}counterpoint{date}.mid in a folder called <generated>. 

Thanks
